# Welcome to the Documentation for Procedural Planet Generation

![Celestial Bodies](./assets/images/planets.png)

Procedural Planet Generation is a Unity framework for creating procedural celestial bodies: stars, gas giants, asteroid rings, moons, and Earth-like planets.

It uses Shader Graph for procedural surface shaders, VFX Graph for star coronas, and Render Graph for atmospheric and glow post-processing effects.

This framework does NOT generate terrain or height-based geometry and does not modify meshes. It does generate procedural surface textures for lightweight, non-landable planets, suitable for space strategy games, solar system maps, background space environments, and skyboxes.
